We write $$S_1 \backsim\ S_2$$ if there's a bijection $$f: S_1 \rightarrow S_2$$.

A set $$S$$ is called _countable_ is $$S \backsim\ T$$ for some $$T \subset \mathbb{N}$$.

The set $$\mathbb{Z}$$ is countable, and $$\mathbb{Z} \backsim\ \mathbb{N}$$. A bijaction $$f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$$ is given by $$f(n) = (-1)^n \lceil n/2\rceil$$.

Summary:

- $$\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$$ are countable, $$\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}$$ are uncountable.
- Finite sets are always countable!
- Infinite sets may be either countable or uncountable.
- If an infinite set is countable, it has the same cardinality as the natural numbers.
