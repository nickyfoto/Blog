$$x\ R\ y = (x, y) \in R$$

$$x$$ is domain, $$y$$ is range

S = {(1, a), (2, b), (3, c)}

domain(S) = {1, 2, 3}

codomain(S) = {a, b, c}

Difference between codomain and range see: https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/domain-range-codomain.html

Maximum of number of relations on set A

$$2^{|\mathcal{P}(A)|} = 2^{|A|^{2}}$$

Number of Relations

S = {1, 2, 3,...n}

Relation | #
--- |---
Reflexive   | $$2^{n^2-n}$$
Irreflexive | $$2^{n^2-n}$$
Symmetric   | $$2^{\frac{n^2+n}{2}}$$
Antisymmetric*   | $$2^{n} \times 3^{\frac{n^2-n}{2}}$$
Asymmetric*   | $$3^{\frac{n^2-n}{2}}$$
transitive | no easy way to calculate

<br>

\* 3 means every pair of non-diagonal element have three choices (0,1), (1,0), (0,0)
